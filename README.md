# **GROWL Example Code Repository**

This repository contains example scripts for processing **Global Reservoir Observed Water Levels (GROWL) dataset**, demonstrating key steps in water level and storage time-series quality control. Two examples are included in this repository:

- **1. ExampleTrainingData.csv**. Raw sample data directly provided by the original data source, presented in its unprocessed form without any cleaning, filtering, or quality control applied.
- **2. DataProcess.py**. This script establishes a standardized data-processing framework for conducting systematic quality control and flagging of GROWL water level and storage time-series data. The workflow encompasses timeline regularization and gap segmentation, outlier detection using an adaptive robust Z-score approach, and monotonicity checks to ensure the physical consistency between water level and storage variables. Additionally, the script employs monotonic mapping for cross-variable interpolation and reconstruction, resulting in continuous, internally consistent, and quality-flagged water-level and storage time series.
